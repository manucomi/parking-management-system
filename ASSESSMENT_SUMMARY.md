- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end authentication tests

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

### 2. Additional Features (Priority 2)

**Current State:** Core functionality implemented  
**Needed:**

- Email notifications for raffle results
- Parking spot history tracking
- Multi-building support in UI
- Password reset flow

**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours

### 3. Production Hardening (Priority 3)

**Current State:** Basic deployment working  
**Needed:**

- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Redis caching layer (planned for v1.1)
- APM/logging service integration
- Error boundaries in frontend

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours
