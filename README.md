## 🎯 Project Overview

This system manages parking spot allocation for residential complexes through a transparent, automated raffle process that rotates assignments every three months. The architecture is designed with scalability in mind, laying the groundwork for future features like license plate recognition and multi-building support.

**Key Features:**

- 🎲 Fair raffle-based parking allocation
- 📊 Transparent allocation history tracking
- 👥 Separate interfaces for residents and administrators
- 🔄 3-month rotation cycles
- 🚀 Designed for future AI integration (LPR)

## 🤝 Contributing

This project follows a **collaborative engineering workflow** with automated version management:

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make changes** with clear commit messages
3. **Create a changeset**: `npm run change:add`
    - Documents what changed for release notes
    - Required for all PRs (CI will block without it)
4. **Open a PR** with description and tests
5. **Get reviewed** and merge
6. **Auto-release** - CI automatically:
