## Project Overview

This system manages parking spot allocation for residential complexes through a transparent, automated raffle process. The architecture demonstrates scalability patterns and production-ready authentication.

**Key Features:**

- Fair raffle-based parking allocation
- Transparent allocation history tracking
- Role-based access control (admin/resident)
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Foundation for AI integration (LPR)

## Architecture at a Glance

```
User → Vercel (Next.js SSR) → Render (Express API) → Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
```

**Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + React 19 (SSR for performance)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (REST API)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with JWT
- **Cache:** Custom SSR cache (future: Redis/Upstash)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend) + Render (Backend)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions → Vercel + Render

## 🤝 Contributing

This project follows a **collaborative engineering workflow** with automated version management:

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make changes** with clear commit messages
3. **Create a changeset**: `npm run change:add`
    - Documents what changed for release notes
    - Required for all PRs (CI will block without it)
4. **Open a PR** with description and tests
5. **Get reviewed** and merge
6. **Auto-release** - CI automatically:
    - Bumps version (semver)
    - Generates changelog
    - Deploys to production

See [Changesets Guide](./docs/deployment/changesets-guide.md) and [Delegation Plan](./docs/team/delegation-plan.md) for details.
