# üß† Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains all **Architecture Decision Records** (ADRs) for the _Parking Management System_ project.

Each ADR documents a key technical or architectural decision made during the project, including its context, alternatives, reasoning, and expected impact.  
The goal is to make architectural thinking **transparent**, **traceable**, and **maintainable** over time.

## üìò How We Structure ADRs

Each ADR follows this standard format:

1. **Title and Identifier** ‚Äî Example: `ADR-001: Database Choice ‚Äî PostgreSQL (Supabase)`
2. **Status** ‚Äî Usually `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Rejected`, or `Superseded`.
3. **Context** ‚Äî The problem or technical challenge being addressed.
4. **Decision** ‚Äî The chosen approach and its justification.
5. **Consequences** ‚Äî The positive and negative trade-offs of the decision.

This format follows the recommendations of [Michael Nygard‚Äôs ADR pattern](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) and is widely used in modern software architecture governance.

## üîÑ Versioning & Lifecycle

- New ADRs are created whenever a **significant technical decision** is made.
- Once a decision is finalized, its status changes to **Accepted**.
- If a later ADR replaces a previous one, it will mark it as **Superseded** (e.g., ADR-007 supersedes ADR-004).
