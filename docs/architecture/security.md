# Security Strategy

This document covers security considerations and implementation status for the Parking Management System.

## Implemented Security Controls

**Authentication:**

- Supabase Auth with email/password authentication
- JWT token-based API protection
- SSR support using @supabase/ssr for secure server-side authentication
- HTTP-only cookies for token storage

**Authorization:**

- Role-based access control (admin/resident)
- JWT verification middleware on all /api/\* endpoints
- Admin-only endpoints for resident management and raffle execution
- Resident endpoints for personal data and raffle participation

**Network Security:**

- CORS whitelist for production and localhost
- HTTPS enforced by Render and Vercel
- SSL/TLS for Supabase PostgreSQL connections

**Data Protection:**

- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- Input validation on API endpoints
- Password hashing via Supabase Auth (bcrypt)
- Environment variables for sensitive credentials

---

## Pending Enhancements

**Rate Limiting:**

- express-rate-limit for API endpoint protection
- Prevent brute force attacks on authentication endpoints

**Password Management:**

- Password reset flow via Supabase Auth
- Email verification enforcement

**Security Headers:**

- helmet.js for standard security headers
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

**Advanced Authentication:**

- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Refresh token rotation

## OWASP Top 10 Coverage

**Addressed:**

- Broken Access Control: Role-based access control implemented
- Injection: Parameterized queries throughout
- Cryptographic Failures: TLS/SSL enforced, bcrypt password hashing
- Security Misconfiguration: Environment-based configuration

**Planned:**

- Security Logging and Monitoring: APM integration
- Software and Data Integrity: Dependency scanning automation
