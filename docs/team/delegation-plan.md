# Team Delegation & Collaboration Plan

This document defines how the **Parking Management System** project would be structured within a collaborative engineering team.  
It focuses on **clear ownership**, **delegation of responsibilities**, and **collaborative workflows** to ensure consistent delivery and scalability.

## Task Breakdown by Feature

### MVP — Parking Raffle Core

| Feature               | Owner        | Tasks                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resident registration | Frontend Dev | UI form + API integration with `/residents`.                  |
| Raffle execution      | Backend Dev  | Implement `/api/raffle/run`, fairness logic, and persistence. |
| Allocation tracking   | Backend Dev  | Create `allocations` table and join queries.                  |
| Dashboard UI          | Frontend Dev | Display raffle results and current status.                    |
| SSR caching layer     | Frontend Dev | Implement SSR caching (in-memory) for API responses.          |
| Deployment pipeline   | DevOps       | Configure Vercel + Render CI/CD.                              |

### Phase 2 — Automation & Scaling

| Feature                | Owner            | Tasks                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scheduled raffles      | Backend / DevOps | Add cron job or AWS Lambda for timed executions.        |
| Redis cache            | Backend          | Replace SSR cache with distributed cache layer.         |
| Multi-building support | Backend          | Add `building_id` fields and update allocation queries. |
| Monitoring & logs      | DevOps           | Add structured logging and uptime alerts.               |

## Collaboration & Communication Workflow

### Version Control & Branching

- **Main branch:** Always stable, production-ready.
- **Feature branches:** One per task or issue.
- **Pull requests:** Required for all merges; must include description + screenshots if UI-related.

### Code Review Process

- PRs reviewed by Tech Lead or peer within 24h.
- Use GitHub templates to document:
    - What changed
    - Why (linked to ADR or Jira ticket)
    - How to test

### Communication Channels

| Tool                | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Slack / Teams**   | Daily syncs, blockers, design feedback.     |
| **Jira / Linear**   | Task tracking, sprints, retrospectives.     |
| **GitHub Projects** | High-level roadmap tracking.                |
| **Figma**           | UI design and component library references. |

### Documentation Standards

- All decisions tracked in `/docs/design-docs/adr/`.
- Major updates documented in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Use `README.md` files in submodules (`frontend`, `backend`) for context.

## Leadership Philosophy

Key principles:

- **Empowerment:** Each team member owns their feature end-to-end.
- **Documentation-first:** Write design decisions before implementation.
- **Shared accountability:** Bugs are owned collectively, not blamed individually.
- **Iteration:** Small PRs > large monoliths.
- **Transparency:** Progress is visible through consistent communication.

---

## Summary

This delegation plan ensures that:

- Each role has **clear ownership**.
- The architecture remains **coherent across teams**.
- New members can **onboard quickly** and contribute effectively.

It reflects an **engineering culture of autonomy, documentation, and continuous learning** — the cornerstone of scalable software development.
