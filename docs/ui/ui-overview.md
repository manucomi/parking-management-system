# User Interface Overview

This section illustrates the visual design and user experience of the **Parking Management System**.

The mockups were designed in Figma to represent the main user flows for both **Residents** and **Admins**, following the system architecture defined in the C4 diagrams.

---

## Design Highlights

- **Clean executive dashboard style**.
- **Consistent navigation patterns** for both roles (Resident and Admin).
- **Modular component hierarchy** aligned with React component architecture (cards, tables, modals, banners).
- **Responsive layout** designed for desktop-first with mobile adaptation.

## Storybook Component Catalog

Storybook serves as the live documentation and testing environment for all UI components.  
Each component includes:

- `.jsx` implementation
- `.module.scss` styles
- `.test.jsx` unit tests
- `.stories.jsx` visual stories

This structure allows developers and designers to validate components in isolation before integration.
